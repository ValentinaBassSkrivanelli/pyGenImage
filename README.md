Project: Image Generator with OpenAI and Streamlit
This project is an interactive web application developed with Streamlit that allows you to generate images from text descriptions using the OpenAI API (DALL·E).

📌 Main Features:
✅ Simple and easy-to-use interface: The application offers a form where the user can enter descriptive text to generate an image.
✅ Customizable options: You can select the number of images to generate (between 1 and 10) and the image size (256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024).
✅ OpenAI Integration: Uses the OpenAI API to generate images based on artificial intelligence.
✅ Error Handling: Implements validations to avoid empty submissions and handles potential API failures.
✅ Easy deployment: Thanks to Streamlit, you can run the application locally or deploy it to the cloud with Streamlit Cloud or Docker.

🛠️ Technologies used:
Python → Main language of the project.

Streamlit → To create the interactive web interface.

OpenAI API → To generate images with AI.

Dotenv → To manage environment variables and keep the API key secure.

🚀 Possible improvements and extensions:
🔹 Add advanced options, such as art styles or image filters.
🔹 Allow downloading of generated images.
🔹 Implement authentication for controlled API use.
🔹 Integrate cloud storage to save generated images.

This image generator is a powerful tool for artists, designers, and anyone interested in AI-powered creativity. 🎨✨
